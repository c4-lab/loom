        "passage": "The Angel’s Game. -- Carlos Ruiz Zafón,   \nEven then my only friends were made of paper  \nand ink. At school I had learned to read and write  \nlong before the other children. Where my school  \nfriends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible  \n  pages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the  \nmystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I  \nsaw in them a key with which I could unlock a  \nboundless world, a safe haven from that home, those  \nstreets, and those troubled days in which even I  \n  could sense that only a limited fortune awaited me.  \nMy father didn’t like to see books in the house.  \nThere was something about them—apart from the  \nletters he could not decipher—that offended him.  \nHe used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would  \n  send me off to work and that I’d better get rid of all  \nmy scatterbrained ideas if I didn’t want to end up a  \nloser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the  \nmattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so  \nthat I could read. Once he caught me reading at night  \n  and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my  \nhands and flung it out of the window.  \n“If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading  \nall this nonsense, you’ll be sorry.”  \nMy father was not a miser and, despite the  \n  hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me  \na few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like  \nthe other children. He was convinced that I spent  \nthem on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets,  \nbut I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed,  \n  and when I’d collected four or five reales I’d secretly  \nrush out to buy myself a book.  \nMy favorite place in the whole city was the  \nSempere & Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It  \nsmelled of old paper and dust and it was my  \n  sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit  \non a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to  \nmy heart’s content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay  \nfor the books he placed in my hands, but when he  \nwasn’t looking I’d leave the coins I’d managed to  \ncollect on the counter before I left. It was only small  \nchange—if I’d had to buy a book with that pittance, I  \nwould probably have been able to afford only a  \nbooklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me  \nto leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on  \n  my soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed  \nthere forever.  \nOne Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I  \nhave ever received. It was an old volume, read and  \nexperienced to the full.  \n  “Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens,” I read  \non the cover.  \nI was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who  \nfrequented his establishment and, judging by the care  \nwith which he handled the volume, I thought  \n  perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them.  \n“A friend of yours?”  \n“A lifelong friend. And from now on, he’s your  \nfriend too.”  \nThat afternoon I took my new friend home,  \n  hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn’t  \nsee it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead,  \nand I read Great Expectations about nine times,  \npartly because I had no other book at hand, partly  \nbecause I did not think there could be a better one in  \n  the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that  \nMr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was  \nconvinced that I didn’t want to do anything else in  \nlife but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.",
