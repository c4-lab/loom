An impressive score on the GRE will have a great impact on your future; therefore, you will want to be adequately prepared. What is the most effective way to prepare? Using a variety of study materials and verifying your readiness for the test by taking GRE practice tests is a good approach. The links above provide access to free resources from Mometrix Academy to assist you in this endeavor. The practice test study guides cover all the subjects included on the GRE: Analytical Writing, Quantitative Reasoning (math), and Verbal Reasoning. A free GRE practice test for Quantitative Reasoning and Verbal Reasoning is also available. You can take the GRE practice tests to assess your knowledge and skills and to gauge how prepared you are for the actual GRE test. The GRE example questions will also expose any areas of weakness that need further study. You may want to consider taking a GRE practice exam for the first time and designate next to each question which of the following statements is true.\n\nI confidently knew the correct answer\nI chose the correct answer but was unsure of my choice\nI had no idea which option was the correct answer\nApproaching the practice test in this way will help you determine your areas of strength and weakness. Once you are aware of these strengths and weaknesses, you can wisely concentrate on the areas that need the most work. The questions that you answered correctly won’t require a lot of study; however, you may want to review this material to confirm that you thoroughly understanding why that is the correct answer. The questions that you answered correctly but weren’t sure about need more time and study. Again, you will want to verify that you thoroughly understand the topic of the question. Most of your study time will need to be focused on the questions that you missed and had no idea of which answer was correct. Don’t stress out over these questions! Mometrix has all you need to prepare and score well on the GRE.",
