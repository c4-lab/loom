            This HIT is part of a research study sponsored by Syracuse University and the National Science foundation.
            It will provide training for the main part of the study, which will be made available in the coming weeks.
            Please note that both this training HIT and other HITs associated with this study will not work on a smaller
            format (e.g., mobile phone) display; please use a tablet or browser on a larger display.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the current (training) HIT, you will be invited to take a survey about your attitudes with respect to
            vaccines, and get training for an online puzzle game (which will be made available in the future). The game
            is like a word jumble, but instead of assembling words into sentences, you will work with virtual neighbors
            to assemble bits of information into stories.
        </p>
        <p>
            The current HIT will take about 30 min and you will be compensated $6 in order to achieve an hourly rate of
            approximately $12/hr. The puzzle games themselves will take about 20 minutes be compensated at the same
            hourly
            rate plus a bonus for achieving a good score in the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            The research study is designed to understand how people’s attitudes (in this case, about vaccines) influence
            how
            they process stories in groups. Your responses on the survey and performance on the training exercise (this
            HIT)
            will determine your eligibility for the games (in subsequent HITs).
        </p>
        <p>
            This study presents little to no risk beyond that associated with other HITs on AMT. Whenever one works with
            e-mail or the internet there is always the risk of compromising privacy, confidentiality and/or anonymity.
            Your
            confidentiality will be maintained to the degree permitted by the technology being used. It is important for
            you
            to understand that no guarantees can be made regarding the interception of data sent via the internet by
            third
            parties.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that during this study, you may be exposed to disturbing information regarding the health and / or
            death of
            a fictional child or other individuals. All characters are fictional and information about health
            behavior should not be interpreted as medical guidance.
        </p>
        <p>
            The information collected in this study (i.e. survey results and game history) will be linked to your MTurk
            Worker ID, but no other identifying information. Your MTurk ID will never be re-shared. The linkage between
            your
            worker ID and collected data will be stored for the duration of this study (until Sept. 2025) in a secure,
            password protected database. Only the lead investigators (Dr. Qiusi Sun and Dr. Joshua Introne) will have
            access
            to this information. The linkage between your WorkerID and study results will be deleted in Sept. 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
            The collected data will be used in scholarly publication. and may be re-shared with other researchers and
            used
            in future studies without additional consent from you or a legally authorized representative, however, this
            data
            will <em>not</em> contain your MTurk identifier.
        </p>
